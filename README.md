# Getting Started with Create React App

>First I read the task document carefully and wrote down the all the manin tasks and sub-devided them into smaller one.

1.Auth Page.

2.Home Page.


1.Auth page.

a.Input's(email,password)

b.Buttons (login,logout)

c.Forgot password Link.

>Created Auth component with email,password inputs and reset password option using custom css with  functions for input validation.

>For Authentication used firebase rest API,stored user details in local storage.

2.Home Page.

>Installed axios and logged the response from API to had a look into response data and based on that decided to define following components.

a.Component for Single Character detail.

b.Component for Single Episode details.

c.Component responsibble for showing all episodes and characters.

>There were around 62 characters and 102 episodes, so decided to repesent them into table with pagination.

>Defined home page with logout,selct and  table elements.

>Next wrote the character component and episode component as table row.

>Used useState and  useEffect hooks to fetch and store data.

>Created list of characters and episodes  by mapping stored data and rendered them as list in table.

>Further improvement will be like adding spinner ,HOC to show error message to user etc.

>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
